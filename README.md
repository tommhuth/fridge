# What's in the fridge?
I got tired of never remembering what I had in the fridge, so I made this simple app to keep track. But obvs mostly to play with Laravel and Angular. Try it out at fridge.huth.io (password = password).
 
Because this is such a simple app,  I let the typography be the main design hook – scaling the font up for larger screens – though I take no credit as the invertor of that idea. Obviously, text sizing and screen space can be an issue here, but overall it seems to work out *okely dokely*. Probably should’ve gotten a less safe typeface than Helvetica though.

## Make it your own
If you want to run this locally fire up `gulp` to generate static resources (js + css + fonts) and do a `migrate` (there’s also a `seeder` available for some startup data). Also, see the example `env file` which also contains the global password used for the app.
